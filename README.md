# betVEX AI agent

This is an AI agent created with Bitte to interact with the betVEX ecosystem.

You need some environment variables to run this agent so if your a judge and want to try it out DM me on telegram @pivortex

You will also need some testnet USDC. You can get them from the faucet, it is the "USDC for VEX testnet" option. https://near-faucet.io/
